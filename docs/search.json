I was inspired from this blog by Dr. Rachel Thomas from FastAI to start documenting my learning. Here are some of my favorite parts of the blog:\n\nThe top advice I would give my younger self would be to start blogging sooner.\n\n\nHelps you learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.\n\n\nYou are best positioned to help people one step behind you.\n\nI am hoping that this blog will keep me disciplined when the discomfort of learning new things becomes real."
