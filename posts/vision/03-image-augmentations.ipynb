    "(@) #### Prevent overfitting - \n",
    "    By creating variations of original images, the model gets exposed to wider reange of possible inputs, making it more generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "(@) #### Expanding Datasets - \n",
    "    When working with small datasets, augmentation can increase the size of the training data. This is useful in deep learning as models generally need a large amount of data to perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "(@) #### Real-world challenges -  \n",
    "    Image recognition task often face challenges like occulusion, light intensity and different angles. This can be introduced to the model at training stages with augmentation so the model can learn to perform under difficulties."
