    "Computer Vision refers to teaching machines to understand and extract information from images and video. There has been research dating back to 1960s to extract contextual information from a visual input and it is a good read for those who are interested. For now let's stick to understanding the modern approach that started with the breakthrough in 2012. AlexNet introduced in 2012 used Convolutional Neural Networks to solve image recognition with a significantly higher accuracy."
