There has been research dating back to 1960s to extract contextual information from a visual input and it is a good read for those who are interested. For now let’s stick to understanding the modern approach that started with the breakthrough in 2012. AlexNet introduced in 2012 used Convolutional Neural Networks to solve image recognition with a significantly higher accuracy."

Although they are related fields they differ in their approach and objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Processing\n\nPixel level operations to manipulate and enhance images\nFiltering, color adjustments, transformations\nWorks at lower level of abstraction with pixel-level features\nDoes not involve learning from data and less demanding\n\n\n\nComputer Vision\n\nAnalysing image content and extract meaningful insights\nObject Recognition, Segmentation, Tracking\nHigher level of abstraction, analyzing contents of the image\nLearning features and patterns from datasets and requires large resources"

I was inspired from this blog by Dr. Rachel Thomas from FastAI to start documenting my learning. Here are some of my favorite parts of the blog:\n\nThe top advice I would give my younger self would be to start blogging sooner.\n\n\nHelps you learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.\n\n\nYou are best positioned to help people one step behind you.\n\nI am hoping that this blog will keep me disciplined when the discomfort of learning new things becomes real."
