    "An image is a grid of tiny squares called pixels. Each pixel is a single point of colour in the image. The resolution of an image is basically group of pixels arranged in a grid format. *n x n* is basically the number of pixels in an image represented as *n* rows and columns. "

    "    RBG is the most common way to store pixel values. Each pixel contains 3 numbers between the values of 0-255. For example, red would be (255, 0, 0).\n",

    "(@) #### Grayscale\n",
    "\n",
    "    Grayscale images are represented using a single number per pixel between 0-255. 0 represents black, 255 represents white and the values in between are different shades of grey.\n",

    "\n",
    "    HSV separates the color and intensity information in a way that's more intuitive. There are many formats that are used to represent HSV, the standard format is as follows:\n",
    "    * Hue - ranges from 0^o^ to 360^o^ and represents the color type\n",
    "    * Saturation - ranges from 0% (no color, grayscale) - 100% (pure color) and represents the intensity of the color\n",
    "    * Value - ranges from 0% - 100% and represents the brightness of the color\n",
