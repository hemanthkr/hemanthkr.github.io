    "text": "Representation of Color Spaces\nImages are described in different color spaces. We will only look at some important ways to represent images that are useful for machine learning tasks.\n\nRGB (Red, Green, Blue)\nRBG is the most common way to store pixel values. Each pixel contains 3 numbers between the values of 0-255. For example, red would be (255, 0, 0).\nGrayscale\nGrayscale images are represented using a single number per pixel between 0-255. 0 represents black, 255 represents white and the values in between are different shades of grey.\nHSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)\nHSV separates the color and intensity information in a way that’s more intuitive. There are many formats that are used to represent HSV, the standard format is as follows:\n\nHue - ranges from 0o to 360o and represents the color type\nSaturation - ranges from 0% (no color, grayscale) - 100% (pure color) and represents the intensity of the color\nValue - ranges from 0% - 100% and represents the brightness of the color\n\n\nIn the interest of keeping these blogs short, we will stop here and discuss diffent ways of image manipulation in the next ones."

I was inspired from this blog by Dr. Rachel Thomas from FastAI to start documenting my learning. Here are some of my favorite parts of the blog:\n\nThe top advice I would give my younger self would be to start blogging sooner.\n\n\nHelps you learn. Organizing knowledge always helps me synthesize my own ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. A blog post is a great way to do that.\n\n\nYou are best positioned to help people one step behind you.\n\nI am hoping that this blog will keep me disciplined when the discomfort of learning new things becomes real."
